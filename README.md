About WhereⒶt
===============

WhereⒶt is a mobile app to help protesters communicate with each other in realtime during marches. It was born out of years of using (and becoming frustrated with) [Celly](https://cel.ly/) as a member of Occupy Wall Street's Direct Action Working Group, and a participant in recent #BlackLivesMatter marches in NYC. 

Unlike Celly, WhereⒶt is free and open source software, guaranteed to be tailored to the needs of activists, because it is made by activists. TLC will keep no data, sell no data, and back up privacy and security pledges with code you can inspect (and help write!)

__In its mature form, WhereⒶt will:__

* use graph diffusion to transmit SMS messages through a social network without a central server (and the costs and security risks that entails)
* combine location-sharing notifications and a reactive map to allow protesters to maintain situational awareness of a march with multiple contingents spread throughout a city
* delete all records within 24 hours and provide encrypted channels of communications to protect communications from state surveillance

Built using [Macroid](https://github.com/macroid/macroid) with guidance from the good folks at [47 Degrees](http://www.47deg.com/)
